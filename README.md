## What we learned

We learned how to bring together the McCormick's API and IBM BlueMix API. We used IBM BlueMix for setting up the URL that we are using as an access point for the McCormick API.

We also learned how to implement a mobile application onto wearable technology.

Although not yet implemented, we learned about IBM Watson's Visual Recognition API that was to be used to recognize images of food and search for relevant recipes using the McCormick API.
